 bm_867_falling:0 "A Sinking Junk"
 bm_867_falling_desc:0 "Ever since the disastrous An-Shi Rebellion and the Yuanhe Restoration (805-820AD), there has been a delicate balance between the imperial court and the Three Fanzhen of Hebei. The Fanzhen military governors need the prestige of the emperor to reassure their citizens, whereas the Tang court relies on the might of the Fanzhen to fend off the Tibetans and Nanzhao. A massive and united Tang army has gathered in the southwest, but irrespective of the outward calm, contradictions and conflicts are becoming acute. A soldier from Guilin is about to become the epicenter, igniting the fire that devours everything..."

 bookmark_falling_licui_desc:0 "Soon after the death of Emperor Xuanzong, Prince Li Wen became the emperor with the support of the Shence Army, thus beginning the Xiantong era (860-874). He changed his name to Li Cui and was honored by his ministers as the emperor of filial piety and virtue. Li Cui was fond of banquets, fine wine and luxurious extravagance, which gave rise to rumors that he was bringing the legacies of his forefathers to ruin. Amidst the opulent music and intoxicating wine in Chang'an, his reign appears peaceful apparently."

 bookmark_falling_wangjingchong_desc:0 "The Wang family from the Uyghur Absi tribe has been inheriting for five generations under the support of their private soldiers. Wang Jingchong is the descendant of this Uyghur Wang family and the daughter of Emperor Xianzong. He maintains the peace between the imperial court and its vassals, thus becoming a symbol of ethnic integration in Hebei. Confronting the decline of Tang Dynasty and the simmering in northwestern frontiers, whichever path will he choose?"

 bookmark_falling_hequanhao_desc:0 "The Tians' regime in Weibo dominated Hebei after the An-Shi Rebellion, claiming An and Shi as apotheoses. But it is widely acknowledged that only the Sogdian private army has supremacy over Weibo. He Quanhao's grandfather, He Jintao, was held up by the private army as a new Jiedushi to ousted Shi Xiancheng. To carry on the tradition of Sogdian clans or to embrace Sinicization? Quanhao might not have much of a choice."

 bookmark_falling_gaopian_desc:0 "As the offspring of great generals, Gao Pian has been growing to maturity among the imperial guards since childhood. He mounted successful defense against the Tibetans and Tanguts in the northwest, fought off the enemy from Nanzhao to regain possession of Annan, and reached the summit of his fame. Giao Chi is politically unstable due to ravages of war and military control. Does the mighty Jinghai Army have other alternatives besides guarding the empire's southern frontier?"

By now, the young and impetuous Meng Shilong has assumed the title of emperor and changed his country's name to Dali, trying to be on an equal footing with the Tang Dynasty. He launched an offensive against Annan and Xichuan Circuit, conquered the former twice but was driven out by Gao Pian eventually. Such a failure put him to shame. Worse still, the White and Black Mywa around Erhai Lake are on the point of stirring up trouble, the Sinicized family has become powerful ministers in court as well. What seeds is Shilong sowing - the rejuvenation or the downfall?"

 bookmark_falling_linghutao_desc:0 "Linghu Tao became imperial chancellor due to his father's legacy in the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Given the power he has enjoyed, his achievements have been lackluster. The hard-driving emperor led to his discreet style somehow. After Yizong's accession, he has been appointed as Jiedushi for four terms and associated with poets like Li Shangyin and Wen Tingyun. The prissy man just hope to nurture his later years, but a unprecedented riot is about to break out!"

Instead of rotating your shifts, the imperial court still want to boost campaign in the southwest. Pang Xun detected that there is a shortage of grain, and their superior officers cheat soldiers out of their pay. The nostalgic troops are getting agitated. Don't you want to hurry home to your family before falling in battle?"

 bm_867_normads_desc:0 "The once mighty Shuofang Army faded away, while the babarians recruited by Shuofang have already thrived. During six decades of war between Tang and Tibet, tribes of Toyghon, Shatuo, Tibetan and Tangut migrated eastwards to submit to Tang's rule. Their leaders became adjutants in the army or held the imperial insignia to fight in Tang's hinterland. In the north, the collapse of Uyghur Qaghanate produced disorder throughout the steppe. The Toquz Oghuz tribes descended into chaos so the power vacuum has not been filled. It is an epoch in which heroes are emerging."

However, the aggrandizing of his tribe has threatened the vassal state of Hedong as well as the Toyghon migrants, for which the latter will brew a mobbing. Guochang and his sons must prove that they are still loyal to Tang's sovereign, and provide living space for the tribe."

He served a Tang general for a dot of habitat. The Tanguts can't be prodigal in this dilemma.

The plundering by Khitans and Qay was put to rest and the trades with Balhae are unimpeded flourishing. The title of imperial chancellor is bestowed upon Yunshen, making him Jiexiang.

The appellation of \"Shirwi Mongghol\" was mentioned in the late Tang Dynasty, not at the head of Onon, but in right bank of Ergune.

 bookmark_silkroad_zhangyichao_desc:0 "Since the overthrow of Tubo rule by troops nineteen years ago, Zhang Yichao's reputation is growing, but he has been jealous and decentralized by the court. Zhang Yichao, who is under house arrest in Chang'an, has transferred power to his son and generals, and still calls himself \"Hexi Jiedu Shi\", rather than the \"guiyi\" canonized by the court; the reason is simple, the Hexi people are the sons and daughters of the Han family who have been occupied by the Fans for many years, rather than the Fanbang who belonged to the heavenly dynasty."

Bughu Jun, who was not born into a lineage of Uyghur Qaghans, rised as he swept away the remnants of rival Tibetans around Tien Shan. He seized the Xizhou region, made contact with Zhang Yichao and the imperial court of Tang to contend for hegemony among Toquz Oghuz. The road towards ascendancy is obstacle-packed, for he feels the pull of Tiele tribes in Yizhou whereas the Uyghur regime in Sulmi won't treat him with indulgence.

Thus, the qaghan was murdered, the tegins were scattered, and countless refugees fleed southwards. Yet the suspicion by the Tang dynasty and threats of other nomads tormented them. At last they went over to Hexi and tabernacled by the Juyan Lake. So what is next? Heading west will be caught in the crossfire of the Tiele tribes east of Tien Shan; heading south, the fertile valley of Ganzhou is at hand, furthermore, the slush from Qilian Mountains nourishes the flock.
