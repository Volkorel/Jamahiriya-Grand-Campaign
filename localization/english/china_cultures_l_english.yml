 innovation_lvlingzhi_desc:0 "During the Warring States period, the ancient Chinese text Han Feizi proposed the establishment of the first all-encompassing autocratic monarchy for the future of the state. During the same time period, Shang Yang from the state of Qin would enact political reforms into practice. The imperial system would eventually be constituted by the time of the establishment of the Qin, which would introduce the system of Three Lords and Nine Ministers, which would also foster the system of prefectures and counties. Units of measurements, currency, and writing would be standardized and books and scholars of the previous regime were burned and buried; vital to ideological integrity. Officials were then to act as faculties of the law from this point forward."

The system became dominant during the Song dynasty (960–1279) "

The Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue mentions a formula composed of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb."
 innovation_paper_money:0 "Banknote"
 innovation_paper_money_desc:0 "The first banknote-type instrument was used in China in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (618–907). Merchants would issue what are today called promissory notes in the form of receipts of deposit to wholesalers to avoid using the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. Before the use of these notes, the Chinese used coins that were circular, with a rectangular hole in the middle. Coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants, if they were rich enough, found that the strings were too heavy to carry around easily, especially for large transactions. To solve this problem, coins could be left with a trusted person, with the merchant being given a slip of paper (the receipt) recording how much money they had deposited with that person. When they returned the paper to that person, their coins would be returned."

 innovation_confucianism_greatagain:0 "Ancient Prose Movement"
 innovation_confucianism_greatagain_desc:0 "Since the Qi and Liang dynasty, the rigidness and ostentation have been more and more close to the obstacle of literature development. Until Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan, the ancient style of literatures were promoted, and therefore formed even a movement. Especially, Han Yu has devoted the most, which prevented prose from being restricted by the chains of traditional literatures, and restored the freedom and simplicity of the prose to its ancient way. Besides, Liu Zongyuan promoted the literatures to be the base of political edification of Confucianism, and thus promoted the legitimacy of Confucianism proposed by Han Yu."
